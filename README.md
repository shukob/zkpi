# zkpi

Proof-carrying instructions: a venue's decision, provable without the inputs that produced it.

Exported from a single research tree by `scripts/export_repos.py`, which is why
the layout is regular across the three repositories and why nothing here is
hand-maintained. Corrections are welcome; they belong upstream, and the export
is re-run.

## What is here

Rust:

- `rust/qomm-zk`
- `rust/qomm-zkpi`

Python:

- `zk/`

`artifacts/` holds the measurements the numbers in the paper are taken from, as
the runners wrote them. Each carries the host it ran on as a label (`host-a`,
`host-b`, `host-c`); `scripts/hosts.py` is the mapping.

## Running it

```
cargo test --release          # in rust/
python3 -m pytest tests/      # from the repository root
```

## Measurements

Every reported number has an artifact and a command that produces it. Where a
measurement needs something not shipped here --- MP-SPDZ, a second host, a market
data feed --- the command says so and fails rather than substituting a default.
